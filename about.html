                <p class="">
                    I have spent a large portion of my adult life trying to find magic in the mundane. I grew up in a
                    culture that embraced motherhood as if it were the only avenue a female could explore-and still find
                    worth.  When I became a mother and over the next decade I searched for that fulfillment in
                    motherhood (the one that I had been promised since I was a little girl). Low and behold I didn't
                    find it. I found joy and tradition, I found happiness and even contentment at times but I never felt
                    fully fulfilled.  I love my children fiercely but the title of "mom" has never brought me the
                    satisfaction that was sold to me my entire life.  </p>
                <p>For a very long time that truth caused a lot of guilt and shame.  I just kept trying harder at the
                    mom thing. When even my best wasn't enough I
                    started to deconstruct the beliefs that had been passed down to me (not just the ones surrounding
                    motherhood but every single belief- it was .... a lot).  In that deconstruction I found new truths,
                    among them- that fact that I could be a good mom AND find fulfillment in a career.  With my new
                    found truths and a tiny bit of confidence (a VERY tiny bit) I decided to write a list of the things
                    that I loved to do.  The things I loved before I became a mother AND after.  From that list and with
                    the help and support of my husband I began exploring career paths that I would love and that would
                    bring me the satisfaction I was searching for.  </p>

                <p>Coding quickly jumped to the top of the list because
                    of my love for numbers, math, data and typing.  I jumped in with both feet.  I started watching
                    youtube videos and mimicking what I saw. I downloaded a coding program and made little games for my
                    kids to play (and a calculator for my son, I'm still damn proud of that calculator :).  Then, one
                    day out of the blue a friend of a friend posted
                    about a program she was embarking on called "Tech-Moms" and my dream of becoming a super rad web
                    developer started to become a reality.
